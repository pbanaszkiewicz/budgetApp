BudgetApp: rescue your home expenses
====================================

I wrote this application to help me keep my home budget tight.  It's written in
Flask (Python web framework) and it uses REST.

I currently do not host BudgetApp anywhere.  I hope to put it up on Google App
Engine or Amazon EC2.
